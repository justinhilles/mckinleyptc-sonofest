        <p>
          SoNo Fest is entirely volunteer powered. From early-morning street closures to the final sweep after sunset, it takes
          a joyful crew of neighbors, parents, and friends to keep things running smoothly. We will pair you with a crew lead
          who makes sure you have everything you need to succeed.
